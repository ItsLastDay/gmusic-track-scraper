A Chrome extension which automatically and continuously saves the current playing Google Play Music song title to a text file.

The name of the file is `song_name_for_obs.txt`.

You can install this extension locally after enabling Chrome Developer Mode. I didn't post this extension in Chrome Store, and I don't plan to.

I use this extension to show the currently playing song on my Twitch broadcast [twitch.tv/wishstand](https://www.twitch.tv/wishstand).
